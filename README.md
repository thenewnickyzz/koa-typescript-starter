A simple boilerplate starter for developing server-side applications with koa and typescript.

There is also a docker-compose file included that will spin-up a postgres container on port 5001 and a pgAdmin dashboard available on port 5000

This repository is intended for learning and it should not be used in production.

## Instalation

`npm install`

Optional: You will also need docker installed if you're planning to use the postgres container.

## Usage

`npm run dev`

Optional: `docker-compose up -d`

Your application is going to run on port `8000`
